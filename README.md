# Coupon impact analysis in retail

## Abstract
The world of retail is always changing and coming up with different strategies to entice consumers. Different advertising strategies include ad campaigns in magazines, store campaigns, coupons among other ways. These strategies depend on the target demographic, the product being marketed, and even the season of the year. Through our project we try to analyse these trends and show using data how stores can benefit more through smarter advertising. \
Using the transactions data about various products and timelines, as well as demographic data of families we will broadly try to answer the following questions.

## Research questions
- We will try to find the more successful campaigns based on the sales of data before and after the campaign start date.
- Which demographics are most and least affected by the coupons/campaigns?
- Successful campaigns correspond to which products, and which departments? \
We will try and explore the above questions by using data from the different tables available.

## Dataset
We are going to work with the Dunnhumby dataset. This dataset contains  household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at  a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included. There are a number of tables, which when joined appropriately can reveal various insights about the data.

## Milestone 3
Some of the plots on our notebook use plotly and can be visualized here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhruti96shah/ada_project_pinkfluffybunnies/blob/master/ada%20project.ipynb

All team members worked together on most of the task but in particular:
- Dhruti Shah: data visualization and interactive plots
- Alexander Cadillon: analysis of campaign success
- Alexander Reynaud: analysis of correlation between success of coupons and demographic informations
- Eleonora Rocchi: development of the data story

All of us will work on the poster and Dhruti will talk in the final presentation.
