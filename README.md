# Commercial Strategies in retail

## Abstract
The world of retail is always changing and coming up with different strategies to entice consumers. Different advertising strategies include ad campaigns in magazines, store campaigns, coupons among other ways. These strategies depend on the target demographic, the product being marketed, and even the season of the year. Through our project we try to analyse these trends and show using data how different strategies affect sales. \
We aim to build a story around the data, which would help us understand and glean useful information regarding the reach, effectiveness, target audience, and other insights about the various campaigns employed by retailers.  

## Research questions
- What different strategies are used by the retail stores?
- Corporate point of view: how do commercial strategies affect sales?
    - based on the product category
    - based on demographics
    - based on the time of the year (seasonal patterns)
- Customer point of view:  how profitable are discount campaigns for consumers? <p>
We will try and illustrate the conclusions drawn from the previous questions by building a data story around some products and their campaigns over time.

## Dataset
We are going to work with the Dunnhumby dataset. This dataset contains  household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at  a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included. There are a number of tables, which when joined appropriately can reveal various insights about the data.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
11.11
- Set up a project repository on GitHub
- Download the dataset and understand the different tables and their relations (schema analysis)
- Run a basic exploratory analysis on the content of the tables (instance analysis): study the distributions, look for mistakes and outliers <p>
18.11
- Combine multiple tables to get more insights into the data
- Look for efficient ways to visualize our results <p>
25.11
- Add documentation and cleanup the code

## Questions for TA
- What do they mean by national and private brands?
- What are the campaign types? How are type A,B and C coupon campaigns different?
- We are given week number, can we know when the data collection started so we can understand the actual week of the year it is?
